                <p class="first-banner-p-font">Hi, this is Nayeem. I am studying B.Sc. in CSE at Daffodil International
                    University. I always
                    try to learn new technology. I like to build PC though I have built it twice only. When I have time,
                    I watch anime, TV series, or movies. I also enjoy listening to music. My goal is to be a computer
                    programmer in the future.</p>
